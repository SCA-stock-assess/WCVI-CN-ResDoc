# West Coast of Vancouver Island Chinook stock assessment work

West Coast of Vancouver Island Chinook were prescribed to Batch 1 of the Fish Stock Provisions following amendments to the Fisheries Act (Bill C-68) in 2018. A rebuilding plan, supported by a Fisheries Science Advise Report (FSAR), was triggered as a result under section 6.2. This repository has been set up to document stock assessment work undertaken to support implementation of Section 6.2 of Bill C-68 for WCVI Chinook.

Overarching projects are:
1) WCVI Chinook Fisheries Science Advice Support (FSAR)
2) WCVI Chinook stock status CSAS Research Document (which supports the FSAR)

For details on Bill C-68, see:

Much of the work in this repository provides direct supporting information to the CSAS Research Document, which in turn informs the FSAR.

Each folder corresponds to a specific analysis or figure in the Research Document and contains all supporting data and code.
