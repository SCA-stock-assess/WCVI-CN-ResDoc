# West Coast of Vancouver Island Chinook stock assessment work

Stock assessment work to support implementation of Sections 6.2 and 6.3 of Bill C-68 (amendments to the Fisheries Act) for WCVI Chinook.

Overarching projects are:
1) WCVI Chinook rebuilding plan
2) WCVI Chinook Fisheries Science Advice Support (FSAR)
3) WCVI Chinook stock status CSAS Research Document (to support the FSAR)

For details on Bill C-68, see:

Much of the work in this repository provides direct supporting information to the CSAS Research Document, which in turn informs the FSAR.

Each folder corresponds to a specific analysis or figure in the Research Document and contains all supporting data and code.
